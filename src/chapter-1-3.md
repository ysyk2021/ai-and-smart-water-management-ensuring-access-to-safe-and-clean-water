Access to safe and clean water is essential for human health and wellbeing. However, water resources are increasingly under threat due to a range of factors, including climate change, population growth, and pollution. In this book, we will explore how artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to address these challenges and ensure access to safe and clean water for all.

Objectives
----------------------

The main objective of this book is to provide an overview of AI technologies and their applications in smart water management. We will examine the potential advantages of using AI in water management, as well as the challenges and limitations of these technologies. The book will also provide case studies of successful AI applications in water management, as well as discussions on policy and regulatory issues related to the adoption of AI in this field.

This book provides a comprehensive overview of the potential of AI in smart water management, as well as the challenges and limitations of these technologies. By examining case studies and policy considerations, the book aims to provide a roadmap for the responsible adoption of AI in water management, with the ultimate goal of ensuring access to safe and clean water for all.
